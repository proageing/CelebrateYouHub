# Celebrate You! — Post-Course Hub

An 8-week post-course engagement app for participants of the *Celebrate You!*
healthy longevity programme. Each week unlocks a nudge (Insight → Reflection →
Challenge → Peer Circle) drawn from the 2026 curriculum. Participants submit
reflections, an AI drafts feedback grounded in the curriculum, and a facilitator
reviews and sends it before the participant ever sees it. Private peer-circle
boards let each course cohort support each other.

## How it's built

- **Frontend** — plain HTML/CSS/JS, no build step. Hosted free on **GitHub Pages**.
- **Database + Auth** — **Supabase** (Postgres, magic-link login, Row Level
  Security). Configured entirely through the Supabase dashboard and SQL editor —
  no server to run.
- **AI feedback drafting** — one small serverless function on **Vercel**, which
  is the only place your Anthropic API key lives. Vercel builds it straight from
  GitHub — nothing to run locally.

Total monthly cost at 30 participants: **$0** (all three platforms' free tiers
comfortably cover this).

## Setup — do these in order

### 1. Supabase project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com), sign up, click **New Project**.
   - Region: Singapore (`ap-southeast-1`).
   - Save the database password somewhere safe.
2. Once provisioned, open the **SQL Editor** → New query. Paste in the entire
   contents of [`supabase/schema.sql`](supabase/schema.sql) and run it.
3. New query again → paste in [`supabase/seed_weekly_content.sql`](supabase/seed_weekly_content.sql)
   and run it. This loads all 8 weeks of curriculum content.
4. Go to **Authentication → Providers** and confirm **Email** is enabled with
   "Confirm email" and magic-link sign-in on (these are on by default).
5. Go to **Authentication → URL Configuration** and add the URL you'll publish
   the site at (e.g. `https://yourusername.github.io/CelebrateYouHub/`) to
   **Redirect URLs** — otherwise magic-link emails won't be able to log people in.
6. Go to **Project Settings → API**. Note down:
   - **Project URL**
   - **anon public** key 
   - **service_role** key (keep this one secret — never put it in frontend code)

### 2. Fill in `js/config.js`

Open [`js/config.js`](js/config.js) and set:

```js
window.SUPABASE_CONFIG = {
  url: "<your Project URL>",
  anonKey: "<your anon public key>",
};
window.PROGRAM_START_DATE = "2026-08-03"; // the Monday your 8-week programme begins
```

The anon key is safe to expose in frontend code — everything it can do is
governed by the Row Level Security policies in `schema.sql`.

### 3. Anthropic API key

Sign up at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com), add billing,
and create an API key. You'll paste this into Vercel in the next step, not into
any file in this repo.

### 4. Deploy the feedback function on Vercel

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com), sign up with GitHub, **Add New →
   Project**, and import this repo.
2. Before deploying, add these **Environment Variables**:
   | Name | Value |
   |---|---|
   | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | your Anthropic key |
   | `SUPABASE_URL` | your Supabase Project URL |
   | `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | your Supabase service_role key |
   | `WEBHOOK_SECRET` | make up any long random string — this stops strangers from calling your function |
3. Deploy. Vercel will give you a URL like `https://celebrate-you-hub.vercel.app`.
   Your feedback endpoint is `https://celebrate-you-hub.vercel.app/api/generate-feedback`.

### 5. Wire up the Supabase → Vercel webhook

1. In Supabase, go to **Database → Webhooks → Create a new webhook**.
2. Table: `submissions`. Events: `Insert` and `Update`.
3. Type: **HTTP Request**, Method: **POST**, URL: your Vercel function URL from
   step 4.
4. Add an HTTP header: `x-webhook-secret` = the same `WEBHOOK_SECRET` value you
   set in Vercel.
5. Save. From now on, every time a participant submits or edits a reflection,
   Supabase will call your function and it'll drop an AI-drafted feedback item
   into the review queue.

### 6. Publish the frontend on GitHub Pages

1. Push this repo to GitHub (see below).
2. In the repo, go to **Settings → Pages**.
3. Source: **Deploy from a branch**. Branch: `main`, folder: `/ (root)`.
4. Save. Your site will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io/CelebrateYouHub/`
   within a minute or two.
5. Double check that this exact URL is in Supabase's **Redirect URLs** (step 1.5)
   — if it doesn't match, magic-link logins will fail silently.

### 7. Make yourself an admin

1. Sign in to the app once with your own email (this creates your `profiles`
   row automatically).
2. In Supabase, go to **Table Editor → profiles**, find your row, and set
   `is_admin` to `true`.
3. Visit `/admin.html` on your site — you should now see the Review Queue and
   Engagement dashboard.

### 8. Add participants and peer circles

For 30 participants, the fastest path is directly in Supabase's Table Editor —
no custom admin UI was built for this since it's a one-time setup per cohort:

1. **Table Editor → teams**: add a row per peer circle (e.g. "Circle A").
2. Participants sign in once via magic link (creates their `profiles` row
   automatically).
3. **Table Editor → profiles**: set each participant's `team_id` to the right
   circle, and fill in `full_name` if you have it (used for greetings and peer
   board post attribution).

## Local development

No local server is required — GitHub Pages serves static files as-is. To
preview locally before pushing:

```bash
npx serve .
```

The one piece of backend code (`api/generate-feedback.js`) only runs on Vercel;
if you want to test it locally you'll need the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli)
(`npm i -g vercel`, then `vercel dev`) with a `.env.local` containing the same
variables as step 4.

## Project structure

```
index.html          Login (magic link)

supabase/schema.sql             Run once in Supabase SQL Editor
supabase/seed_weekly_content.sql  Run once, after schema.sql

api/curriculumContext.js   Curriculum framework reference given to the AI
```

## Notes on the 3-month re-assessment

Week 8 in the app prompts participants to re-score their Wheel of Life and
declare a Keystone Habit, but the formal 3-month re-assessment (per the
Assessment Framework doc) is intentionally **not** built into this app — link
out to your separate assessment survey when you're ready to send it.
